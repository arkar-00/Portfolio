I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.

  bio: "Hello! I'm Arkar Oo. I'm a mobile developer for Modus Operandi. I studied CompSci at University of Computer Studies, Maubin. I'm a self-taught developer with a solid background in React Native application development. Highly motivated and eager to enchance my skills, continuously seek opportunities to learn and adapt to new technologies. As a quick learner, I can easily pick up new tools and frameworks. I enjoy long walks on the beach, and I believe artificial intelligence will inevitably rule us all one day. You should hire me!",
